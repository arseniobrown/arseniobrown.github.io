# Introduction

**Welcome to the Cybersecurity Threat Hunting and Detection Lab!**

In this engaging and hands-on lab, I am excited to guide you through the world of cyber threat hunting and detection. Before we dive into the exciting world of identifying and mitigating digital threats, let's ensure you're all set up for success. Below are the lab requirements and prerequisites, providing you a clear roadmap to get started:

**Lab Requirements:**

1. **Hardware:**
   - A computer with sufficient hardware resources to comfortably run virtual machines.
   - A compatible operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Software:**
   - VMware Workstation: A virtualization platform that will serve as the foundation for our lab environment. It allows you to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Basic Computer Skills:**
   - Comfort with basic computer operations, file management, and software installation.

2. **VMware Workstation Installed:**
   - Ensure you have VMware Workstation installed on your computer.

3. **Lab-Specific Software:**
   - Downloaded virtual machine images for:
     - PfSense: A powerful firewall and router platform that will be a cornerstone of our lab's network security. [Pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)
     - Splunk: A leading data analysis and visualization tool for exploring and monitoring data from various sources. [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html)
     - Ubuntu: A versatile Linux distribution that we'll use for certain cybersecurity exercises. [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
